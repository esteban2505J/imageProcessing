# README: Image Processing - Geometric Shape Analysis

**Project:** Geometric Shape Analysis (Filtering Lab)  
**Author:** Juan Esteban Ram√≠rez  
**Date:** September 3, 2025  

## Description
This project implements image processing techniques in Python (OpenCV) and MATLAB to analyze geometric shapes, specifically an annulus (`anillo3.png`). It measures areas and perimeters, detects shapes (circles, annuli, etc.), and compares them with another image (`coronaCircular3d.jpg`). The pipeline includes preprocessing, filters, morphological operations, arithmetic/logical operations, transformations, and contour detection. Results are saved as images and in an Excel file (`resultados_formas.xlsx`).


## Requirements
- **Python**: `opencv-python`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas` (`pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib pandas`)
